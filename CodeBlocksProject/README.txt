CodeBlocks Project for wxWabbitemu on Windows
==============================================
As with any IDE project, you will need to modify it if the config
inside does not match your current system config.

I've installed CodeBlocks with MinGW, used MinGW to compile, and
used wxPack's library files to compile, all of which are in the C:
drive.

After you've configured EVERYTHING, you can hit the build button to
get building, and then the run button to run! :)

This build is not very good - it exposes some platform-dependent
quirks that are VERY visible on Windows (just run it and you'll
see!). Therefore, please don't try to use this for production
purposes... :P
